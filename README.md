Nope, it's not another framework. This is a set of the most popular components used in many web applications. These components can act as a "core" for a fresh development, are fully customizable and the markup is minimal so you can use and style them as you please. You don't have to worry about browser issues as they were tested against cross-browser & cross-platform compatibility:

- Chrome
- Safari
- Mobile Safari (iDevices)
- Firefox
- Opera
- IE8+
